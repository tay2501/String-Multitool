# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a lightweight clipboard transformation tool for Windows 11 that allows users to apply various text transformations to clipboard content using keyboard shortcuts. The tool addresses the frequent need to manually edit clipboard text by providing automated transformations through configurable rules and hotkeys.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Windows user, I want to transform clipboard text using keyboard shortcuts, so that I can avoid the manual process of pasting, editing, and copying text multiple times per day.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a configured keyboard shortcut is pressed THEN the system SHALL read the current clipboard content
2. WHEN the transformation is applied THEN the system SHALL update the clipboard with the transformed text
3. WHEN the transformation completes THEN the system SHALL provide visual or audio feedback to confirm the operation
4. IF the clipboard is empty or contains non-text content THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without crashing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure custom transformation rules, so that I can define specific text conversions that match my workflow needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load transformation rules from a configuration file
2. WHEN a user modifies the configuration file THEN the system SHALL reload the rules without requiring application restart
3. WHEN defining a transformation rule THEN the system SHALL support regex patterns and replacement strings
4. IF the configuration file is missing or corrupted THEN the system SHALL create a default configuration with sample rules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want predefined transformation rules for common conversions, so that I can immediately use the tool for typical text formatting tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the default configuration is created THEN the system SHALL include hyphen-to-underscore conversion (TOM-QUERY → TOM_QUERY)
2. WHEN the default configuration is created THEN the system SHALL include underscore-to-hyphen conversion (TOM_QUERY → TOM-QUERY)
3. WHEN the default configuration is created THEN the system SHALL include SQL IN clause formatting (TEST1\nTEST2\nTEST3 → 'TEST1','TEST2','TEST3')
4. WHEN the default configuration is created THEN the system SHALL include full-width to half-width character conversion (港区１ー１ → 港区1-1)
5. WHEN the default configuration is created THEN the system SHALL include half-width to full-width character conversion (港区1-1 → 港区１ー１)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the tool to be lightweight and portable, so that it can be deployed on corporate Windows environments without complex installation procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is distributed THEN the system SHALL be packaged as a standalone executable or Python script
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL consume minimal system resources (< 50MB RAM)
3. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL not require administrator privileges for installation
4. IF Python is available THEN the system SHALL utilize the existing Python installation rather than bundling a runtime

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive logging of transformation activities, so that I can track usage patterns and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transformation is performed THEN the system SHALL log the timestamp, transformation type, and success status
2. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL maintain log files with automatic rotation
3. WHEN log files exceed one year old THEN the system SHALL automatically delete old log entries
4. IF log files become corrupted THEN the system SHALL create new log files without affecting application functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow best practices, so that the tool is maintainable, extensible, and readable for future enhancements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL follow PEP 8 coding standards for Python
2. WHEN functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive docstrings and type hints
3. WHEN the architecture is designed THEN the system SHALL use modular design with clear separation of concerns
4. WHEN new transformation rules are added THEN the system SHALL support plugin-like extensibility without core code changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully, so that it continues working reliably even when unexpected situations occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clipboard access fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue running
2. WHEN a transformation rule fails THEN the system SHALL skip the rule and try alternative rules if available
3. WHEN keyboard shortcuts conflict with other applications THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. IF the system encounters critical errors THEN the system SHALL restart automatically while preserving user configuration
