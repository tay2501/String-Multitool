# Dynamic Clipboard Refresh Feature - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature enhances the interactive mode of String_Multitool to allow users to dynamically refresh the input text from clipboard during an active session, enabling seamless workflow when working with multiple text snippets without restarting the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Clipboard Refresh Command

**User Story:** As a user running String_Multitool in interactive mode, I want to refresh the input text from clipboard using a simple command, so that I can work with new clipboard content without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user types 'refresh', 'reload', or 'r' in interactive mode THEN system SHALL read current clipboard content and update the working text
2. WHEN clipboard refresh is successful THEN system SHALL display the new input text (truncated if necessary) and confirm the update
3. WHEN clipboard is empty or inaccessible THEN system SHALL display appropriate error message and keep current working text
4. WHEN clipboard content is identical to current working text THEN system SHALL inform user that no change was detected

### Requirement 2: Automatic Clipboard Detection

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to optionally detect when clipboard content has changed, so that I can be notified of new content availability without manually refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user enables auto-detection mode with 'auto' command THEN system SHALL monitor clipboard changes in background
2. WHEN clipboard content changes during auto-detection THEN system SHALL display notification about new content availability
3. WHEN user types 'auto off' THEN system SHALL disable automatic clipboard monitoring
4. WHEN auto-detection is active THEN system SHALL display current mode status in prompt

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Interactive Commands

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear commands to manage clipboard operations, so that I can efficiently work with multiple text sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user types 'commands' or 'cmd' THEN system SHALL display all available interactive commands including clipboard operations
2. WHEN user types 'status' THEN system SHALL show current working text length, auto-detection status, and last refresh time
3. WHEN user types 'clear' THEN system SHALL clear current working text and prompt for new input source
4. WHEN user types 'copy' THEN system SHALL copy current working text back to clipboard

### Requirement 4: Improved User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive feedback and status information, so that I understand the current state of my working session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interactive mode starts THEN system SHALL display available clipboard commands in help text
2. WHEN working text is updated THEN system SHALL show timestamp of last update
3. WHEN displaying working text THEN system SHALL show character count and source (clipboard/pipe/manual)
4. WHEN clipboard operations fail THEN system SHALL provide specific error messages with suggested solutions

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want all current functionality to remain unchanged, so that my existing workflows continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing commands (help, quit, transformation rules) THEN system SHALL behave exactly as before
2. WHEN starting interactive mode THEN system SHALL maintain current initialization behavior
3. WHEN applying transformations THEN system SHALL continue to update working text as current behavior
4. WHEN new commands conflict with transformation rules THEN transformation rules SHALL take precedence

### Requirement 6: Performance and Resource Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want clipboard monitoring to be efficient and not impact system performance, so that the application remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auto-detection is enabled THEN system SHALL use efficient polling mechanism (max 1 check per second)
2. WHEN clipboard content is large (>1MB) THEN system SHALL warn user and ask for confirmation before loading
3. WHEN memory usage exceeds reasonable limits THEN system SHALL provide option to clear working text
4. WHEN clipboard monitoring encounters errors THEN system SHALL automatically disable auto-detection and notify user
